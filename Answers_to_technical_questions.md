### How long did you spend on the coding test?
I spent approximately **4 hours** on the coding test to complete the required tasks and ensure functionality. The time was also spent on debugging and optimizing certain areas to meet expected standards.

### What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
For my **Task Manager** project, I used **JavaScript (Node.js)**, where one of the latest useful features in ES2022 (JavaScript's latest version) is the `top-level await`. This feature allows `await` to be used at the top level without needing to wrap it in an `async` function. It is particularly helpful for asynchronous operations at the start of a script.

#### Example Snippet Using Top-Level Await

```javascript
// Importing a module and awaiting a database connection at the top level
import { connectToDatabase } from './db.js';

await connectToDatabase();

console.log("Database connected successfully.");
```

With `top-level await`, code readability improves, and I can manage async operations more efficiently, especially for setups requiring an immediate asynchronous process, such as database connections.

### How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
To track down a performance issue in production, I would follow these steps:

1. **Log Analysis**: Review application logs to identify slow endpoints or error logs. These logs provide initial hints on where the issue might be occurring.
2. **Performance Monitoring Tools**: Use tools like **New Relic**, **Datadog**, or **Prometheus** to monitor real-time performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory, request latency, and throughput.
3. **Database Profiling**: Use database profiling tools to check for slow queries, missing indexes, or inefficient joins.
4. **Code Profiling**: Run a profiler (e.g., **Node.js profiler** or **Chrome DevTools**) on key areas to pinpoint bottlenecks in the code itself.
5. **Load Testing**: Simulate traffic to test how the application performs under different loads and identify capacity limits. Iâ€™d use tools like **Postman** and **Thunder Client** to simulate multiple requests and analyze response times and errors.

#### Load Testing with Postman and Thunder Client
- **Postman**: Primarily a tool for API development, Postman also offers a feature for load testing APIs by using collections with multiple requests. To perform load testing, you can create a **Collection Runner** with multiple iterations of requests to observe response times and check for errors under simulated load. Postman allows chaining requests and visualizing response times, making it useful for testing small-scale loads in development.

    ```plaintext
    Example: Run 100 iterations of an endpoint, such as /tasks, with a set delay to simulate high usage.
    ```
    
- **Thunder Client**: Thunder Client, a lightweight extension for Visual Studio Code, allows quick API testing directly in the editor. While not as comprehensive as Postman for load testing, Thunder Client can execute multiple requests in a sequence, making it useful for lightweight testing and debugging individual endpoints. For higher loads, however, Postman or a dedicated load testing tool is recommended.

I have previously addressed a performance issue in a production environment. Following these steps helped me isolate the bottleneck to a database query that lacked proper indexing, which I resolved by adding indexes to improve query performance.

### If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
If I had more time, I would consider adding the following features and improvements to the Task Manager application:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement secure user authentication and role-based authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify their tasks.
2. **Real-Time Notifications**: Implement WebSockets to notify users of task updates or deadlines in real time.
3. **Collaborative Task Management**: Allow multiple users to collaborate on tasks by adding comments, file attachments, and activity logs.
4. **Task Prioritization and Categorization**: Introduce features for setting task priorities and categorizing tasks into projects, enabling better organization.
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Add an analytics dashboard for users to track productivity, completed tasks, and time spent on different tasks.
6. **Improved User Interface**: Enhance the user interface with a modern, responsive design for better user experience across devices.

These features would make the application more robust, user-friendly, and beneficial for users aiming to increase productivity.
